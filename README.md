# pandas-challenge-1

## Background:

The following code is focused on data analysis with Python's Pandas library which involves examining, cleaning, processing, and extracting useful information from large datasets.  The scope of this code is to identify from a given dataset the top customers, popular product categories, and calculating profits through data exploration, transformation, and analysis.
The code will require functions and import of a csv file. 
This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/algjor/athletic_sales_analysis).

## Description of Code:
This code was completed using the following steps.
(1) - A repository was created called pandas-challenge-1 in Git hub.
(2) - A starter code named wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb was created on the local Git repository and pushed to GitHub.
(3) - The csv file client_dataset.csv was imported for the data analysis.
(4) - The csv file was read in as Dataframe.
(5) - The data was explored using df.columns and df.describe functions to veiw the columns and data statistics.
(6) - From the data, the following questions were addressed:  (a) What three item categories had the most entries?
(b) For the category with the most entries, which subcategory had the most entries? (c) Which five clients had the most entries in the data? (d) How many total units (the qty column) did the client with the most entries order?
(7) - The data was transformed by performing several calculations on columns.
(8) - The transformed data was then verified through confirmation.
(9) - The data was then displayed and formatted.
(10) - The key findings of the data analysis are:

Client ID 24741 outperforms other clients in terms of total profits on a scale of magnitude -- as the other clients within the top 5 perform relatively the same. The increased total profits for Client 24741 is attributable primarily to a greater number of Total Units Purchased in respect to the other clients.  This gives Client 24741 a significant advantage in terms of Total Profits.
